            <p>
              Hello there! I'm Chislaine Cruz, founder of Careerpathy. My journey into starting this company was inspired by a desire to share my knowledge and experiences with others. It all began when I wrote a couple of online articles, diving into my personal journey as a bootcamp graduate transitioning into my first full-time tech job. To my surprise, these articles resonated deeply with aspiring software engineers who reached out to me seeking guidance and support. That's when I realized the immense value I could provide to those starting their career in tech, and Careerpathy was born!

            <p>Since 2021, I have been working as a Fullstack Software Engineer, starting as an apprentice and progressing to a full-time engineering role. Along this path, I've gathered invaluable experiences and insights that have shaped my understanding of the industry. What fuels my passion is the opportunity to teach others how to become a better engineer and achieve a fulfilling and rewarding career. </p>
